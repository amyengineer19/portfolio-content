            In addition to user research skills, I have also gained several competencies surrounding design,
            prototyping, and the product lifecycle.  Last semester, I developed a pitch and accompanying prototypes
            for an internship-search app for students.  I challenged myself to take this project all the way to a
            mid-fidelity prototype, which allowed me to ideate and refine my product at several stages in the
            development process.  I strove to really understand who my customer base is and what their needs are
            to confidently develop a concept that provides utility and function.  I then took the time to develop
            personas, conduct a competitor analysis, and scope the app and its key features.  The wireframing and
            prototyping stage involved several rounds of sketches and wireframes before using Figma to develop the
            design and the interactions.

        <p>The app is meant to help students find mini-internships and be able to track their projects and tasks,
            as well as provide a communication platform with their supervisor, all on the same platform.

            Creating my own prototypes for an app on Figma allowed me to flex my skills as an interaction
            designer and as a graphic designer.  I learned how to make logical click flows and microinteractions.
            I took this project from start to finish, starting with the problem statement and needfinding process,
            to the sketches and QOC, all the way to creating a mid-fi prototype. It's still a work in progress, but
            I've learned a lot and I look forward to iterating on this project more!
