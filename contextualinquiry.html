            The Problem- the client expressed frustration with their current database management system and their
            overall process for customer recruitment and matching, a yearly process that is a large portion of their
            work.  After meeting with the client to understand the organization and their goals for this project, we were
            ready to start conducting interviews with the three different stakeholder groups.

            Contextual Inquiry- prepping the interview questions well in advance proved useful and I improved my
            inquiry skills with each iteration.  As I drilled down to understand what exactly is not functional about
            their recruitment and matching methods, their communication with their customers, and Airtable, I was
            able to collect a lot of qualitative data.

            Affinity Wall- these translate to recommendations for how their new platform, Salesforce, should function.

            Productive Client Solutions- the process was very informative and led to several implications.
            Every finding was attached to a recommendation.  I strived to ensure that every recommendation included
            actionable steps, with a timeline and the intended improved outcomes.

            For example, it became apparent that their process of recruiting, scoping, and matching customers
            to the right program is a lengthy process that has several points of improvement.  Check out what
            I presented to the clients below!
